/**
 * # RedwoodJS's Babel Config
 *
 * This Babel config is for the framework--all the `@redwoodjs/*` packages. NOT for apps.
 * You can find that babel config in ./packages/internal/src/build/babel/common.ts.
 *
 * We use the recommended strategy for monorepos (see https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files#monorepos):
 *
 * - a babel.config.js file (this one) in the root directory
 * - per-project .babelrc.js files
 *
 * ## Historical Note
 *
 * Many options that `@babel/preset-env` took--targets, assumptions (formerly, `loose`)--are now at the top level[^1].
 * This is mainly the result of babel rethinking their polyfilling story[^2].
 *
 * `targets` in particular is super important. It used to be an option to `@babel/preset-env`,
 * but that meant other presets/plugins didn't know about it. `targets` didn't matter for most of them,
 * but `plugin-transform-runtime`, which was responsible for polyfilling, really should've known about it.
 *
 * Since the plugin we used for polyfilling didn't know what we were targeting, it polyfilled as much as it could.
 * That's why we saw things like `Array.prototype.forEach` (which has been in Node.js since 0.10.0) being polyfilled.
 *
 * But now that `targets` is top-level, all presets and plugins know the target, and only do as much as they need to.
 *
 * (Also, by specifying core-js options in `@babel/preset-env` and `plugin-transform-runtime`, we were effectively polyfilling twice.
 * But since `@babel/preset-env` knew the target, it didn't include much.)

 *
 * ## targets
 *
 * Answers the question "Where's the code going to run?"
 *
 * It dictates syntax transforms and polyfills. So it's very important!
 * All RedwoodJS packages target Node.js 14.x.x, but we override it for web packages.
 *
 * We need to bump this at a regular cadence. It's mainly deployment providers (Netlify, Vercel) that dictate this.
 *
 * ## assumptions
 *
 * We can tell Babel to cut some corners we don't care about to produce smaller or more-performant code.
 * See https://babeljs.io/docs/en/assumptions#enumerablemodulemeta.
 *
 * ## plugins -> @babel/plugin-transform-runtime
 *
 * This one is an optimization; it dedupes babel-specific helpers. See https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-runtime.
 *
 * ## plugins -> babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3
 *
 * This one does all the polyfilling. We use the "usage-pure" method because we want polyfills
 * to be imported in a way that doesn't pollute the global environment:
 *
 * ```
 * // in
 * let obj = Object.fromEntries(entries);
 *
 * // out
 * import _ObjectFromEntries from "object-polyfills/from-entries";
 * let obj = _ObjectFromEntries(entries);
 * ```
 *
 * The "usage" part means Babel only polyfills what we use, not everything it possibly can.
 * See https://github.com/babel/babel-polyfills/blob/main/docs/usage.md#method.
 *
 * ## shippedProposals
 *
 * Some tc39 proposals have shipped in browsers, but haven't been included in the spec yet.
 * (Because it hasn't been published). Setting `shippedProposals` to true opts us into them.
 *
 * Note that we have to set shippedProposals in two places:
 *
 * - `@babel/preset-env` for syntax proposals (numeric separator)
 * - `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` for method proposals (String.prototype.matchAll)
